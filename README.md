# CSGO-steam-market-item-fetcher

A simple program (terrible code) that fetches ID's and prices of specific CSGO items off of steam market website. This information can be then used to download more specific data (exact wear values) about a given item using this node.js plugin (https://github.com/joshuaferrara/node-csgo).

Note: items.xml needs to be updated since there are a few new skins missing from the list.
